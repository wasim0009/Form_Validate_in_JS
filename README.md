**Project Overview:**
Create a dynamic and user-friendly form validation project using JavaScript to enhance the user experience and ensure data accuracy. This project will involve implementing real-time validation checks for various form fields.

**Key Features:**

1. **Responsive Design 📱:**
   Ensure that the form adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across devices.

2. **Form Fields Validation ✅:**
   Implement validation for essential form fields such as name, email, password, and others. Display clear error messages when users enter invalid data.

3. **Real-time Validation 🔄:**
   Enable real-time validation as users type, offering instant feedback on the validity of their input. This creates a smoother and more intuitive interaction.

4. **Password Strength Meter 🔒:**
   Include a password strength meter to guide users in creating secure passwords. Provide visual cues and messages to help them meet the required criteria.

5. **Email Format Verification ✉️:**
